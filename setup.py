"""
setup.py — wheel/sdist build guard.

The upstream distribution remains unavailable as a generic wheel. This IoT
fork may additionally build its separately named ``hermes-agent-iot``
distribution only with an explicit release marker. That marker prevents
accidental local artifact creation; it is not an authorization boundary.
Release authorization is enforced by protected Git tags, the GitHub ``pypi``
environment, Trusted Publisher OIDC claims, and immutable Action SHAs.
The lightweight wheel intentionally omits repository-level bundled assets
(skills, optional-skills, optional-mcps, and Desktop/TUI/Web build artifacts),
as documented in README.md and README_PI2.md.

This file overrides the ``bdist_wheel`` and ``sdist`` setuptools commands
to raise an error unless running in Nix or an explicit IoT release build. The PEP 517
``build_wheel`` / ``build_sdist`` hooks in
``setuptools.build_meta`` call these commands internally, so the guard
fires for ``uv build``, ``pip wheel``, ``python -m build``, and direct
``setup.py`` invocations alike.

The one legitimate consumer of ``build_wheel`` is uv2nix, which calls
``setuptools.build_meta.build_wheel`` (→ ``bdist_wheel``) inside a Nix
build sandbox. ``nix/python.nix`` sets ``HERMES_NIX_BUILD=1`` on the
Hermes package derivation, so only that build may create an artifact.

Editable installs (``uv sync``, ``pip install -e .``, ``nix develop``)
use ``build_editable``, which does NOT call ``bdist_wheel`` — it calls
``build_ext`` in editable mode. So the guard does not affect development.
